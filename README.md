# PINS-JavaBytecode-Compiler
A PINS to Java bytecode compiler, created as part of my undergraduate diploma 
thesis.

---

## 1. Description

This compiler is a part of my CS Undergraduate diploma thesis, in which
I attempt to expand the [PINS Compiler](https://github.com/LukaSveigl/PINS22-Compiler)
created as part of my Undergraduate course in **Compilers and Virtual machines**,
by changing the back-end compilation process to target the **Java Virtual Machine**,
instead of the educational PINS interpreter kindly provided by our professor.

## 2. Language specifications

The PINS programming language is a simple, general-purpose
programming language created for educational purposes. The specification for the
language can be found in [pins21-specification-SLO.pdf](), and the grammar
for the language can be found in [PINS-grammar.txt](). Some examples of PINS
programs can be found in [prg]().
